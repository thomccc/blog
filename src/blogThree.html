        <h3>Reading response</h3>
        <h5>Artefacts</h5>
        <p>In whole, I find these two readings quite similar, as both try to find a deeper understanding of artifacts but in different ways. One presents its understanding through a walkthrough of the Sony Walkman as its main example, the other, focus on the anthropology side, in which science plays a major part in its exploration.
          <br>
           <br>

In the Walkman piece, the major point is that there is a path or a set of links that chain artifacts to its meanings and its culture. The author makes the connection between culture and the meaning of things. Culture is more of a process, where the meaning of a certain item grows or circulates within a certain community. And so does the idea of meaning. Meaning takes time to develop too. One item does not come with a clear and acknowledgeable meaning at first, but it can different through time. It is like building a brand, we start with a few associations then it builds up to have its own styles and meanings. Then it has its own company culture and finally, the brand creates an impact.
<br>
<br>
Artifact basically is a chain of words. The words then provide meanings or images to us which in return, we understand why something is valuable or not. It is fully explored through the media of advertisement. Any advertisement starts with brainstorming. We collect keywords for what a product want to be associated with, or what it meant for the customers. The author also points out the genre- new media. With full curiosity, it is essential for us to give identities to these new prototypes.
<br>
<br>
In the other essay, the author explores the definition of essential artifacts in depth through the various scope, such as its relationship to people, time and the environment. The author once again mentions the significance of meaning for any artifacts. Artifacts can be categorized and classify through its class by varies measures such as senses.
<br>
<br>
I think our definition of artifacts or for our culture is similar to how marketing or advertising works. We try to create meanings and identities through our products. If we can not associate certain words or give meaning for a certain object, then it is rather pointless for its existence, or it could only be seen as art.
