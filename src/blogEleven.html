        <h3>Reading response</h3>
        <h5>On Utopian Ideology</h5>
        <p>Museum is a place to get inspired. There is no new design that is entirely independent, we have to get inspired by other works. While we have more online resources as we turn into a digital world, we have to understand museum is the original form where one can get the necessary information and ideas for their inventions.
<br>
Museum is mentioned as a community in the Renaissance notion. It is “an idea and a set of practices”. And the idea of museum is consistently evolving or adapting to the society. We could not determine the exact notion of one museum but one could provide a set of guidelines to the viewers.
<br>
I also find “art is itself a mode of inquiry” quite interesting. Art is not just art, it links to philosophy, to current affairs, and many more. It has different scope and depths for understanding one object or one piece of history.
<br>
The Utopian idea is one that includes the past, the present and the future. It can’t be entirely seen or recognized but one could feel or realized it subtly.

        <h3>V&A COLLECTION</h3>

        <p>V&A collection is the apparent choice for me. It has always been one of my favorite museum in the UK or even in the world. The collections are all very well-sorted and categorized. One could feel the royalty through the ornamentation and details in the museum. And this elaborate aura carries towards the digital world. I would say V&A has one of the most distinct website for a museum. All the actions and buttons are very clear but doesn’t lose the sense of grand form. The design language of this museum is very beautiful from the logo itself. The logo is very compact but still delivers it’s characters clearly and stylishly. The uniformed descender height with smooth diagonal line creates one of the best logo in this field. V&A has a vast online resource for museum items from paintings to fashion. Owning to the clear categorized online resource, I choose this museum as my base for the individual project. I decided to choose its furniture collection due to its practical variables when it comes to an AR app. I believe furniture is one of the most useful type to be displayed in an AR app and we haven’t dived into this categories yet. It can be perfectly placed in any surroundings and many of V&A’s furniture collection are items one can hardly find in any commercial furniture shop. In addition, I think my design language has similarity to V&A’s concept of design. The simplistic modern design is very appealing to many.</p>
