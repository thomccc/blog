        <h3>Reading response</h3>
        <h5>Week 12</h5>
        <p>trying to deliver the right amount of message or information to the viewers.
<br>
To create a balance between different works of art, to present interesting and fresh concepts and artworks.

<br>
Not to over expose one of idea over another, not to be too ambitious about the exhibitions.
<br>
The importance of the exhibition maker, he/she is the first viewer of any event, so it needs to reach certain criteria and standard.

<br>
The exhibition should provide some freedom to the viewers, it should leave some questions for discussion and provide meaningful conclusion to an exhibition. While it can leave space for negotiation, the artist should still be an authoritative source and provide useful guidance to the viewers.
<br>
In whole, there is still a lot to be negotiated and an exhibition has multiple rings that connects with each other. It is hard to be successful at completing all the tasks and find a balance in it.
           <br>
           Exhibition, creating relationship/ link between works. The exhibition should help to make the artwork shine, it let artwork provides it distinctiveness. Exhibition should also spark questions, let it become innovative. For example for galleries, it hasn’t been around for long, just one or two hundred years, I think the contemporary sense of exhibition is the same, we shouldn’t let it stop evolving.

        <h3>Week 13</h3>

        <p>“ For the longest time, museums, galleries and the art world and art market in general have been mostly “objectoriented” and have configured their framework and infrastructure to accommodate the presentation and preservation of the static art object.”
          <br>
          The new media art has seen its taking an opposite stance to the object oriented art world. Many of the newer art work are much more conceptual and idea based. It uses different medium and effect to deliver a message rather than solid forms.
</p>

<br>

          <br>
          <p>“After approximately three decades, video now seems to have found an established, safe place in the art world but the museums relationship to performance or sound as art forms remains a problematic one. “
            <br>
          “One of the biggest challenges for the presentation of new media art is to engage the audience for a period of time that is long enough to allow a piece to reveal its content.”
</p>
          <br>
          <p>I think these two extracts are interesting and a bit contradicting. It is true that video art has gain attraction in museum environment and more video art has been shown in an exhibition space, but does the video art engage with everyone? I think the challenge exist, that video art needs to attract the audience in a relatively short amount of duration. </p>


          <br>
          <br>
          <p>“The necessity of a closer collaboration between curators and artists is mainly due to both the development process of the work — which may be a collaboration between several artists in the first place — and its presentation within the physical space.”

            <br>
            Curator and artist can be seen as inseparable especially in contemporary era.  We often see that an artist also act as a curator in many time. The role of an artist has changed drastically over time. Artist has to tell the story of the work and develop its story to the viewers. The nervous system is a good example, where the artist tries to tell a story in its work. It is both an exhibition and an artwork. The long developing duration seen this continuously developing work of art. As the author wrote in the end, the idea of curate has changed drastically, the word takes a bigger responsibility.
