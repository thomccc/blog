        <h3>Reading response</h3>
        <h5>On Augmented Space and Situated Computing</h5>
        <p>What kind of experience does augmented space provide? This is the main question of Manovich’s article. First, he focuses on the topic of data. He acknowledges data as one of the major components of today’s tech world. He lists surveillance, cell space, and electronic displays as three examples of applications of data. These examples obviously demonstrate the major role data plays in our digital world. Data has the power to predict. From the stats the machine collected, systems are able to optimize for different user’s needs, so the providers can provide information that more relevant to our current feelings and opinions. Data has become one of the most important assets for any tech company. Nearly every website is optimized for each user. Youtube recommends videos that link to your preferences and watch history. The google ad service displays products that the user is more likely to get distracted for and purchase.
          <br>
           <br>

The author also talks about the idea of immersion. We often evaluate the screen size of any device, but the author dips into the relationship between physical space and its digital possibilities. The author draws a connection between augmenting spaces and the chance to reconfigure our spaces. Many spaces now added another layer of data, which is this digital facade. I wonder if this is the reason why minimalistic designs are so popular nowadays as it leaves spaces for our digital tools.
<br>
<br>
The author provides an intriguing example which is Libeskind’s design for the Jewish Museum in Berlin which its facade is a digital map of the past Jewish residences in this block. Technology provides an alternative for design. Many famous contemporary architects like Zaha Hadid heavily use technology as its main tool for creating intricate and unimaginable designs.
<br>
<br>
Lastly, the writer points out a very important point between our culture and the tech world. He suggests cultural institutions usually follow the trends of the tech industry, as many components of a gallery or a public space need the tech to work. But with the emergence of augmented space, institutions might be on the same level with the tech industry this time, since the tech industry needs a lot of data and experience from institutions to built a meaningful and aesthetically pleasing space.
<br>
<br>
The other essay on augmented reality portrays AR as a method of mediation, something additional to our existing setup of technology. There still are many flaws and disadvantages with AR technology. For example, people might not take it too seriously, it might always be treated as an experimental playground. Also,the handset is not easy enough to navigate or use yet, too many restrictions applied for the users. We pose the question that can it ever be a part of us or will it always be an additional piece of wear? Would it ever feel easily enough as opening the Instagram app, or unlock using the Face ID? Right now, AR is not really natural for humans.
        <br>
         <br>
         The last essay focuses on Situated computing. It is about how the algorithm evolves or changes depends on the location or actions of the users, which relates to the first reading. In some way, situated computing depends heavily on data. It is the evolving process or growth of software.
Situated computing also lets the user see a bigger picture by putting pieces of a puzzle together. The other keyword is constructive memory, it is the reconstruction of data when needed, a quick rebuild of memory. It adapts to different situations which also is an efficient way of software developing and storing data since it would know what information is more important and what isn’t over time.

      <h5>EXERCISE THREE</h5>
        <p>Exercise 3 coming soon, facing a few problems including the different ways of functions between canvas and the rest, also how the screen size differ between the game screen and actual ios devices. Felt a bit problematic with the trigger functions.</p>

        <p>My AR app will focus on some of the works of Jeff Koons who sold the most expensive art work as a living artist. 91.1 milion dollars... </p>
