        <h3>Reading response</h3>
        <h5>Week 9</h5>
        <p>In Battro’s essay, he mainly discusses the significance and implication of the great transformation of art. First, the idea of this relationship between museum and the art work is very eye catching. It seems nowadays that museum become the sole owner for the art of the public. So in someway how museum displays a piece of art work determine the trajectory of the future of art. I think another very important point from Battro’s essay is that the presentation of art by museum does not always align with how art was originally portrayed (the history of the art work).
<br>
Then the author talks about the concept that art is always updating, it has new life since the work will be shared with different people. This correlates to the future of art and how we process them. Does this mean as people change their concepts about things, as the younger generation deal with problem differently to the other generations that art work have to change with the people? We have to make art welcoming or inviting to the viewers so maybe this change to the essence of art is needed.
<br>
Battro supports this change, especially adding new elements including virtual tours of the museum. However, as Walter Benjamin mentioned in his essay, maybe excluding this notion of specific site and a specific dimension, the aura of an artwork might disappear. Battro also points out the idea of interaction, it is also interesting but I think more importantly we shouldn’t forget the essence of art, its original form.
<br>
<br>
<br>
We need study or tests to support the different implementation to the online museum, since the whole idea of moving online is relatively new. From the reading, it is also apparent that site map is extremely crucial for a well-developed website as the items within this website is immense. One other important take from the reading is the important to have a good consumer/ user experience, not only it make the whole process more convenient but also greatly improve the possibility for them to use again.

        <p>The idea of art and culture is closely related, in Bourdieu’s essay, he emphasizes the nobility of culture or art. It shouldn’t be easy to understand or analyze. People need certain class to extract the essence of a piece of art. Taste has classes, it has a hierarchy in accordance to the hierarchy we normally talk about. The social differences in art and cultural consumption will always be there, since art should have boundary or somewhat exclusive.
</p>

<br>

          <br>
          <p>In the other essay, museum is looked at as a conflicted institution. While it needs to fulfill its mission to educate, it still has to guide the viewers in the right track. Museum also has to find the right position on the balance, presenting a fair analysis or study to the audience. The museum has to push the viewers to better understand both the knowledge and theory of art as a ecosystem. It is important for museums to create their modules on studies and be assertive on the lessons they want to deliver.</p>
          <br>

          <br>
          <br>
          <p>few interesting quotes: “Culture needs are the product of upbringing and education”
          <br>“Popular taste applies the schemes of the ethos”
          <br>“Taste classifies, and it classifies the classifier”
