        <h3>Reading response</h3>
        <h5>General</h5>
        <p>The two introductions on interaction design provide different aspects on the topic. One lists many important criteria for a good digital interactive work, including visibility and feedback. The other talks more about linkages within a design. For example, a well thought out web project should have guidance for every step and every link. Interaction is creating links between different scenes. The author also mentions the importance of having a great layout - mapping. Providing a plan is important, especially for interaction design. In my view, interaction design is still very hard to grasp right now, since it is still a new medium. People use it differently and present in different ways. Nevertheless, a clear layout is important.
        <br>

        <h5>Cultural approach to interaction design</h5>
        In this essay, the author states the purpose of investment in interaction design. Creating new works in this new medium helps us better understand the world.
        And the process of creating these digital artifacts reflects how we think in daily life. Experimentation in digital work is different to other mediums, because it is a new medium and building up a work is like solving a puzzle or building up a house using lego.  here are many small blocks needed for a project to get completed.

        <h5>Video games</h5>
        The viewpoint in this article is quite interesting. It talks about the Possibility Space, which is our relationship to space through the game engines illustration.
        Video games also consist of many rules and procedures which shows the complexity of any games. In whole, the authors argues video games as a precise way of thinking, making arguments and express ideas. Especially through the learning of unity, I understand the complexity or the procedures included in video games. Overall, mapping is important in any digital form and a clear logic is essential.</p>

        <p>The first attempt for export wasn't sucessful as the camera wasn't opened. However, after I rebuilt the entire animation in a new unity file, the AR file worked. It shows that there are some small error in my previous unity attempt. I was able to create the game objects easily, but spent a while to figure out how to display them in order. I also spent quite a lot of time trying to understand Raycast, but unsucessfully... I hope I will able to learn how to place objects in position that I wanted.</p>
