        <h3>Reading response</h3>
        <p>The first reading, Man-Computer Symbiosis, provides some critical points about the relationship between people and machine. None of the points listed are very novel or surprising to us today. We are closer than ever before to this symbiosis. The impressive thing is that the essay was written in the 1960s, when computer hasn’t even arise and hardly find one. In Licklider’s theory, computer would have the same importance as human since it was a symbiosis between the two which implies that one will assist another and this relationship is mutual. In my view, the re are two main points from Licklider’s essay.First, computing helps to alleviate the amount of thinking we have to do which suggests that computers somewhat would take the initiation of any process. Secondly, computers help to increase the efficiency for technical parts of any process. In other words, there might be two ways how we could cooperate with computers. Either human still take the major role in this symbiosis or vice versa. The author realizes the fact of the rapid growth of computing. Personally, I think symbiosis is a dangerous form of relationship between man and computer. I’m afraid of one day when computer would take the lead of one project then takes control of the entire digital world. We have to acknowledge the rapid work rate of computers.  On a side note, it is interesting that the idea of “thinking center” was already pointed out in 1960s which nowadays are shown as think tank, a similar kind of think center.

        In the Ultimate Display, Sutherland discusses the various parts or accessories that construct the final image or a functional machine. In retrospect, computer isn’t an independent object, it has many helpers which made the main object to run successively. The author also pointed out the inter-relationship between the real world and the computer. The ultimate display, in his opinion, is computer controlling existing matters. This would be a very complex way of presentation, where the real world lives in the computer’s world or the computer becomes the main steerer of the real world. Anyway, this kind of experience is somewhat unthinkable in my opinion.

        The last reading focuses on the different usage of augmented reality. It is interesting to see where this “new” technology was at during the 2010s. Obviously, it was just more of an experiment back then. We can see the huge improvements for AR from 2010 till now. AR definitely is a more wholesome package nowadays. The industrial and military application section is particularly intriguing. It shows that the idea of Hololens was an idea that was formed way earlier than its first launching date. Even for the newest Hololens 2, the biggest marketing point is similar to this section of the article. Augmented reality helps to enhance the working experience and make installation easier for complex or bigger projects. I have the opportunity to take a close look of the Hololens a few years ago, it was amazing to see how it helps to provide guides for very difficult tasks that exists in many industries. And I believe it is one of the major advantage of augmented reality— the enhanced visual guide. </p>

        <p>The exercise takes a lot longer than I thought, since it was my first time using the software. It was interesting to see the animation goes. But still a few problems such as how to make certain images disappear and doing more motions with the objects. Overall, it was a fine experience. </p>
