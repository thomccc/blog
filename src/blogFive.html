        <h3>Week 6 Reading Response</h3>
        <h5>On Augmented Space and Situated Computing</h5>
        <p>Museum4punkt0 creates a close relationship between academic fields an actual usage. There is a trend of moving into digital assistance as technology provides the possibility to create a database and provide visual and more apparent representation.

<br>
Furthermore, interaction is like a step forward to all these. As stated in many articles we read before. Museum is like a learning community, certain conversations and interaction is necessary for its purpose.
<br>

Another notion for the program is to have digital research in the museums rather than outsourcing it. This initiative helps to provide new concepts under the scope of technology.


<br>
Other important things mentioned from the introduction includes the emphasis on physical and social space and create defined audience groups.

      <h3>Week 7 Reading Response</h3>
      <h5>Key concepts of museology</h5>
        <p>One keyword mentioned in the reading is “Intangible collection”. It refers to finding new ways to make old objects become museum relevant to the time while preserving the basic understanding or the nature of the object. It is a conservation for both its past and its future. </p>
        <br>
        <p>From the reading, we could also understand that displaying objects isn’t the only function of museum. While it is the main function, the museum is also the key asset for different researches, conservation and communication duties. </p>

        <br>
        <p> -- (Mediation as an educational communication strategy, a bridge between objects and the viewers)</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h5>End of museum // Digital age </h5>
        <p>“Humanizing influence against the over intellectual”</p>
        <br>
        <p>The essential notion of this article is to construct a well-developed and understanding path for all. The objects in a museum is not as approachable as a book on the shelf. The mission of the museum to provide well-researched and accessible knowledge to its audience.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Other points:
          <br>
-Problem how to view a piece of artifact
<br>
-Many conditions to provide the right environment for viewing
<br>
-Research and practice</p>

<br><br>
<p>In digital age, the main motif is that the concept of the community and and culture is equally important to the space, the physical space. We have to focus on more of this community to provide a better learning experience to the visitors. At core, it is a public institution where the technology helps to perfect or improve this educational purpose of any museums. Since the involvement of technology, the space itself isn’t as demanding as before as we could indirectly alter the physical world through technology. The museum experience in someway is not the same as the physical space, it might be two distinct themes to explore. All in all, we have to accept that community is at the core of any museum experience in the digital age. In addition, more thought need to put into construct the perfect taxonomy of this museum space.</p>
